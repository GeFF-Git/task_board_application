# Fix Create Task Functionality

The task creation form currently has several issues:
1. The status options dropdown is empty.
2. The assignees are hardcoded mock values.
3. Multiple assignees can be selected when only one is allowed.

To pull the real users from the database, we found out there's currently no dedicated endpoint in the backend for users list. We first need to add a `UsersController` in the backend API to expose the users to the frontend. Then we'll update the frontend to use real data.

## Proposed Changes

### Task Board API (Backend)
#### [NEW] UsersController.cs
- Add a new API controller `UsersController` with a `GET /api/v1/users` endpoint to return a list of registered users containing [Id](file:///c:/Users/ETR%20Infotech/Desktop/task_board/task-board-ui/src/entities/user/api/user.service.ts#37-40), `FullName`, and `Email`.
#### [NEW] UserDto.cs
- Define a DTO for returning user details securely.

### Task Board UI (Frontend)
#### [MODIFY] user.service.ts
- Modify the [UserService](file:///c:/Users/ETR%20Infotech/Desktop/task_board/task-board-ui/src/entities/user/api/user.service.ts#4-45) to perform an HTTP call to `/api/v1/users` instead of returning mock users.
#### [MODIFY] task-create-dialog.component.ts
- Address the multiple assignee selection issue by changing `assigneeIds` multiple-select to single-select UI mapping.
- Fix the empty status dropdown issue (which might be due to `columns()` returning empty unexpectedly or `columnId` mapping improperly—will ensure stores load).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Build and run the backend using `dotnet run`.
- Serve frontend `ng serve`.

### Manual Verification
1. Click "Create Task", the status dropdown should have the columns (Backlog, In Progress, etc).
2. The Assignee dropdown should show actual registered DB users.
3. The Assignee selection should only allow selecting one user.
4. Completing the form should create a task without errors.
